Based on the following literature, which of the following statements about TCB2 are correct?
Options:
  A: Deletion of TCB2 affects vacuolar morphology by altering fusion/fission dynamics and causing vacuolar fragmentation through disrupted sphingolipid metabolism at membrane contact sites.
  B: Mutations in the TCB2 protein can confer increased tolerance to toxic monoterpenes such as limonene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
  C: TCB2 deletion leads to increased production of replacement jet fuels in yeast by enhancing biosynthetic pathways for monoterpenes.
  D: Complete deletion of TCB2 improves yeast tolerance to biojet fuel blends without any additional genetic modifications.
